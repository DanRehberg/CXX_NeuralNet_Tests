# CXX_NeuralNet_Tests
Testing performance of parallel matrix operations in a Neural Network

Groups of tests split by directories.
- UnitTests
  - Contain the Matrix function and performance testing code
- NeuralNetworkTests
  - Contain performance test between NeuralNetwork with and without parallel Matrix operations
  
**Currently**, parallel matrix operations are limited to multiplication with three multiplication options currently available in the UnitTests workspace.
